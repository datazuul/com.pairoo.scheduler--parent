Some notes for developers

Decisions & notes
- usage of plain hibernate is encouraged. Not JPA overhead.
- dom objects will be reused from pairoo main application (domain module)
- DAOs will be reused from pairoo backend.db module
- no annotations in live; JUnit-Files with Annotations are ok
- use of freemarker for mail templating
    - Not velocity: last update is out of 2010
    - Not Wicket templating: would require to start a wicket application (servlet container ...); to much overhead
- l10n for mail templates is done with the help of freemarker logic (different templates for different languages)
- There are three sources of tasks
    - 'TODO:' in code
    - Task section in this document
    - JTrac entries
- mail configuration
    - Live mailserver is as follows
        - Server: h2010489.stratoserver.net
        - see springBeans-COMMON.xml (bean mailServer) and properties files for details
    - For DEMO following mail acocunts are used
        - sender: pairoodev@pairoo.com
        - recipient: pairootst@pairoo.com
        - PW: t3A#now42
- Default Locale is set to english (in application) Otherwise, the default locale is detected from the platform executing the application.
  These platform could differ (dev; demo; prod) and setting the value, it could cause 'wrong' (or unexpected) translations
- L10n is done with the help of xml property files
    - class com.pairoo.frontend.scheduler.application.business.l10n.LocalizedStrings (extends com.datazuul.framework.i18n.LocalizedStrings)
    - property files are stored in according directory to location of LocalizedString class
    - naming schema is LocalizedStrings_XX.properties.xml (where XX is the country code)
- Mail templates are stored in the subdirectory 'templates' of the directory structure of the class that uses the template See..
  com.pairoo.frontend.scheduler.application.business.PartnerSuggestionJob as class and
  com.pairoo.frontend.scheduler.application.business.templates.PartnerSuggestion.html.ftl as template for Mails.
- DOM Assumptions & Notes
    - User.UserProfil.ProfilTyp is never null
    - User.UserProfil.GeoLocation is never null (while registration an exisiting zipcode and country must been choosen)
    - User.UserAccount.PreferredLanguage is never ANY (even if enum does allow ANY; default is english; drop-down for user does not contain ANY)

Technical Debts:
- If any of the entities / aliases within a criteria query are not set in db,
  query-result will be empty (see UserDaoImpl)
- If freemaker templates are stored in the same directory as the Job that uses theses templates, they are not found.
    - Possibly a naming problem; For now solved by putting the templates into a subdirectory.

Tasks
- email template should support l10n
    - email template properties should not use hard coded strings (e.g. Online/Offline; Value if family state not given..
- create a shell script to start this application


To discuss with Ralf
- Confirm: If familystate is set do DONT_SAY or ANY, it is not shown in proposal mail.
    - Comment: Should familystate really be shown in proposal mail??
- Comment: c.p.f.s.a.businnes.PartnerSuggestionJob .. search for Ralf. Could you comment on this?
- Comment: Why are translation in lowercase? See german translation of familystates.. Looks bl√∂d in proposal mail.
- Comment: I can only provide a single artifact (file) as a result of a project. Currently i have an executable jar as result for the runner project. If i want to create batch/shell script
  that starts the excutable jar, i would have to create another project that groups the executable jar and the script in one aritfact (possible a zip) Does this makes sense? Is it not enough
  to just state how you can execute the executable jar in the documention?
    Answer: Just correct/complete this script: pairoo-frontend-scheduler/runner/src/main/sh/pairoo-scheduler-daemon.sh
    Reask: Script is ok; but we need to chat about this (single artifact in repository only; extract -exucutable- artifact to get to shell script; modification necessary if new version number)
- Confirm: SearchProfile always has min and maxAge set.
- Confirm: SearchProfile always has GeoArea set.
- Confirm: SearchProfile always has at least one Ethinics set.
    - If ethnics list is empty (not null, empty!), search for matching user results in an hibernate error.
- Confirm: Sender-Mailadress is configured in springConfig. Reason: It is the sender mail adress AND the username for mailserver authentication. As lastmentioned is configured in springConfig,
    this value als needs be put into this configuration file.
